*Topplers Node Test Server*

This is a test server used so that I can access from the outside easily for prototyping.

To run locally, either start with 'node topplers.js' or use 'foreman start' from heroku toolbelt. 

package.json - details for the package used by foreman or heroku
Procfile - used by heroku to define how to start the app + web dyno
